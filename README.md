# WWDC Archives

Some old WWDC talks have disappeared, making it difficult to access valuable historical content. This repository aims to serve as an archive for old WWDC content, ensuring that these resources remain available for future reference.

Contributions are welcome, so feel free to submit a pull request if you have any old WWDC talks to add. Archive.org is also a good place to archive HTML, videos, large files, etc. Linking to archive.org instead of the original page would be great.
